### Hello, I am Stephen Gray, and this is my portfolio.

## I designed this portfolio using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. All features were created in separate branches following GitFlow conventions, and all HTML was written following BEM conventions. 

## This page features all of the work I've done up to date through my Nology training course. If you'd like to see my current work, I've also linked my GitHub within the page.
